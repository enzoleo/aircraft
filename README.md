# Aircraft War 
Quick implementation of a simplified aircraft war game with a graphics user interface. This simple game is implemented in `Java` and `python`.

## Quick Setup

Before running the game from the provided source files, you should quickly setup the environment, especially for the `java` implementation.

### Java

The source files are only compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04` system. For other operating systems, we do not have a check in detail but it should still work fine in a correct environment.

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-14-jdk
sudo apt install openjdk-14-jre
```

After executing this command in terminal, you should have already installed `OpenJDK` and `OpenJRE` correctly. Check the `java` version by `java -version` and you will get the following output if everything goes fine:

```reStructuredText
openjdk version "14.0.2" 2020-07-14
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 14.0.2+12-Ubuntu-120.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 14.0.2+12-Ubuntu-120.04, mixed mode, sharing)
```

To compile the sources and run the binaries, you can select any IDE or even work on them only with an editor. A common choice might be using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com). Open the root directory in the editor, and don't forget to install `Java Extension Pack` extensions. Simply click button `Run` and start the game!
